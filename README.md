Sales Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze sales data to gain insights into various aspects of sales performance. It involves exploring different metrics such as total sales revenue, average order value, customer acquisition cost, and more, to understand sales trends and make informed business decisions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains sales transactions from multiple branches of a company. It includes information such as invoice ID, branch, city, customer type, gender, product line, unit price, quantity, total amount, date, and time of purchase, among others.

Analysis
Common Metrics:
Total Sales Revenue: Sum of all sales transactions' total amounts.
Average Order Value (AOV): Average value of each order placed.
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Cost associated with acquiring a new customer.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Predicted net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer.
Additional Analysis:
Average Sales and Average Demand per Day per Product Line: Computes the average sales and demand per day for each product line.
Sales Trends Over Time: Analyzes sales trends over daily, monthly, and yearly periods.
Product Line Performance: Evaluates the performance of each product line based on sales revenue, quantity sold, and other metrics.
Tools and Technologies Used
SQL: Structured Query Language for querying and analyzing the dataset.
MySQL: Relational database management system used to store and manage the sales data.

Future Improvements
Incorporate more advanced analytics techniques such as predictive modeling and customer segmentation.
Visualize the analysis results using charts and graphs for easier interpretation.
Explore external factors (e.g., economic indicators, seasonality) that may influence sales performance.
