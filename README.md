## üìà Project Overview
The project consists of three main analysis categories:
1. **Product Analysis**: Analyzing the performance of different product lines to identify which ones are performing well and which need improvement.
2. **Sales Analysis**: Analyzing the sales trends of products to evaluate the effectiveness of sales strategies.
3. **Customer Analysis**: Identifying different customer segments, their purchase trends, and profitability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Wrangling
The first step in the project is data wrangling, where we clean the data to handle missing or null values. The following steps were performed:
- **Build a database**: Created a database and inserted the data.
- **Handle NULL values**: No null values were found as all fields were set to NOT NULL during table creation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering
Feature engineering was performed to generate new columns for deeper insights:
- **Time of Day**: A new column `timeofday` was created to categorize sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.
- **Day of Week**: A new column `dayname` was created to extract the day of the week for each transaction (Mon, Tue, etc.).
- **Month of Year**: A new column `monthname` was added to indicate the month of the year (Jan, Feb, etc.).

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to answer the business questions listed below. Visualizations and summary statistics were used to uncover insights.
